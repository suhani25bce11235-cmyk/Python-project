# Mood-Based Movie & Song Suggestion System
# Introduction to Problem Solving Project
Mood-Based Movie & Song Recommendation System
A simple and interactive Python program that recommends movies and songs based on the user’s current mood. This project is designed for beginners in programming and problem-solving.

📌 Project Overview
This project asks the user how they are feeling and provides a list of movies and songs tailored to that mood.
It uses basic conditional statements (if-elif-else) and user input handling in Python.

🧠 How It Works
The program starts by displaying a welcome message.

It asks the user: "How are you feeling today?"

Based on the mood entered, it shows curated movie and song recommendations.

If the mood is not recognized, it displays general suggestions.

🎬 Supported Moods
The program recognizes the following moods:

happy

sad

stressed

bored

romantic

angry

If the user enters anything else, a default list is shown.

💻 Code Explanation
The project uses:

input() – to receive user mood

.lower() – to handle case-insensitive input

if-elif-else – to provide correct recommendations

print() – to display movie and song lists

This makes the project beginner-friendly and perfect for understanding decision-making in Python.

▶️ How to Run
Install Python (if not installed)

Save the script as:

mood_recommendation.py
Run the script in the terminal or any Python IDE:

python mood_recommendation.py
Enter your mood when prompted.
